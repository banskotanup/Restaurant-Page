# Restaurant-Page
For my **Restaurant Page** project in The Odin Project, I’ll be dynamically generating a website using JavaScript and Webpack. Instead of static HTML, I'll use JS modules for each section—Home, Menu, and Contact—managing content through DOM manipulation. This will help me improve my skills in modular design, ES6, and bundling tools.
